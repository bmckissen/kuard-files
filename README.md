# kuard-files

While reading Kubernetes Up and Running, I discovered that many of the YAML file examples were already out of date.  Not surprising considering the the speed of K8s development.

I decided to create this repo to provide up to date (as of 5/17/20) examples.  Translating the older files to newer versions was a great learning exercise.

I have no intention of keeping this repo up updated after I have finished the KUAR book.  If you happen to stumble across this repo, be advised that the examples are probably out of date.
